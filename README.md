# 🧩 Sudoku Solver using Simulated Annealing 🧩

### 🧐 What is Simulated Annealing?
Simulated Annealing (SA) is a probabilistic metaheuristic used to find good (often near-optimal) solutions to optimization problems, especially in large search spaces. The name and inspiration come from the annealing process in metallurgy, where a material is heated and then slowly cooled to increase the size of its crystals and reduce defects.
